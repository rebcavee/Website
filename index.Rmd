## Filtering Rows and Columns

In SQL, you can filter columns by using SELECT and rows by using WHERE. Let's look at an example using the Lahman baseball database. First, we should load the Lahman package. We will also need the sqldf package.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

Let's take a look at an example. Suppose we want to see the home run totals for the 1927 Yankees. We could write:

```{r}
query<-"select playerID,teamID,yearID,HR from Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```
